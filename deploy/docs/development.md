# Developing for Stratos UI

In this section, we describe how to set up your local development environment so that you are able to run through the application end-to-end.

## OLD DOCS TO BE REVIEWED

For more implementation details, please see the following pages:
* [Overview](docs/README.md)
* [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
* [Plugins](docs/plugins.md)


## System Requirements
Nginx is used to serve static files while a Golang based REST API backend. Another container hosts the Postgres database for session and service instance management.

This project depends on the following:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/mac)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - to easily install Node.js modules
* [portal-proxy](https://github.com/hpcloud/portal-proxy) - Golang based REST API

## Installation
Install Docker and clone the repositories listed above at the same level as this project.

### Build and run
See the README in the `stratos-deploy` repo for details on how to develop against the Console.

## Docker commands and development tools

### View Logs
```
docker logs stratos-ui
```

### SSH into the running container
```
docker exec -it stratos-ui /bin/bash
```
or, from the stratos-deploy project
```
docker-compose run --rm ui bash
```

### Running Karma tests in container
```
$ cd tools
$ npm test
```

### Running Protractor tests in container
```
$ cd tools
$ npm run update-webdriver
$ npm run e2e
```
By default tests will execute against the local machine's ip address. To run against, for example, the gulp dev instance use
```
$ npm run e2e -- --params.host=localhost --params.port=3100
```

### Running ESLint in container
```
$ cd tools
$ ./node_modules/.bin/gulp lint
```

### Running gate check script
This runs the unit tests and linting.
```
$ cd tools
$ npm run gate-check
```

### Generate documentation (experimental)
Locally, run the following command to generate documentation in the `docs/src` folder. You can then view the documentation by pointing your browser to the `index.html` file of that `docs/src` folder.
```
cd tools 
./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc ../src/app ../src/*.js -r -d ../docs/src
```






TODO:
---

Please ensure you have the following installed:
* Docker

#### <a id="running-ui-manually"></a>Run Docker Compose manually ####
* Generate portal-proxy binary. Follow the directions in the repository's [README](https://github.com/hpcloud/portal-proxy):
  - `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hpcloud/portal-proxy`
  - Install dependencies
  - Set environmental variables
  - Set up developer certs
  - `./deploy/build_portal_proxy.sh`
* Back in stratos-deploy, build and run:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d
docker logs -f stratosdeploy_ui_1
```
