# Deploying as a Cloud Foundry Application

## Deployment Steps

The quickest way to install Stratos UI is to deploy it as a Cloud Foundry application. To do so, clone the `stratos-ui` repository, cd into the newly cloned repository and push to Cloud Foundry. This can be done with:

```
git clone git@github.com:SUSE/stratos-ui.git
cd stratos-ui
cf push
```

You will then be able to open a web browser and navigate to the console URL:

`https://console.<DOMAIN>`

Where `<DOMAIN>` is the default domain configured for your Cloud Foundry cluster.

To login use the following credentials detailed [here](../docs/access.md).

If you run into issues, please refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](#troubleshooting) below.

Note:

1. You need the cf CLI command line tool installed and available on the path.
1. You need to have configured the cf cli to point to your Cloud Foundry cluster, to be authenticated with your credentials and to be targeted at the organization and space where you want the console application be created.
1. You may need to configure Application Security Groups on your Cloud Foundry Cluster in order that  Stratos UI can communicate with the Cloud Foundry API. See [below](#application-security-groups) for more information.


## Troubleshooting

### Application Security Groups

If you have problems when deploying Stratos UI as a CLoud Foundry application, check that the Application Security Group you have will allow the Stratos UI to communicate with the Cloud Foundry API.

For information on the default ASGs, see [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/asg.html#default-asg).

To configure a new ASG for the organization and space that are using for the Stratos UI, first create a new ASG definition, for example:

```
[
   {
      "destination":"0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255",
      "protocol":"all"
   }
]
```

Save this to a file, e.g. `my-asg.json`.

> Note: this allows example all network traffic on all IP ranges - we don't recommend using this.

Unbind the existing ASG for you organization (`ORG`) and space (`SPACE`) with:

```
cf unbind-security-group public_networks ORG SPACE
```

Create a new ASG using the definition you saved to a file and give it a name, with:

```
cf create-security-group NAME my-asg.json
```

Bind this ASG to your `ORG` and `SPACE` with:

```
cf bind-security-group NAME ORG SPACE
```

### node_modules and bower_components

Check the log for deploying Stratos UI with:

```
cf logs console
```

If you see errors relating to bower, check to see if you have local `node_modules` and `bower_components` folders. If you do, delete these and try to push the application again.
