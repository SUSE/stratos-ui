Stratos is an Open Source Web-based UI (Console) for managing Cloud Foundry. It allows users and administrators to both manage applications running in the Cloud Foundry cluster and perform cluster management tasks.

## Deploying Stratos

Stratos can be deployed in the following environments:

1. Cloud Foundry, as an application. See [guide](deploy/cloud-foundry)
2. Kubernetes, using a Helm chart. See [guide](deploy/kubernetes)
3. Docker, using docker compose. See [guide](deploy/docker-compose)
4. Docker, single container deploying all components. See [guide](deploy/all-in-one)

## Quick Start

To get started quickly, we recommend following the steps to deploy the Stratos Console as a Cloud Foundry Application - see [here](deploy/cloud-foundry).

You can also quickly deploy Stratos, using the all-in-one container:
```
$ docker run -p 4443:443 splatform/stratos-ui:latest 
```

You can access the UI on `https://localhost:4443`
