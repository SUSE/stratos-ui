<h1>Step 3</h1>

<p>
	This step illustrates using 'onEnter' and 'showBusyOnEnter' to show a busy indicator and message before you enter this step. This
	allows you to perform some logic to fetch data or other task before the step is shown. The busy indicator and optional message is shown
	while the onEnter task executes.
