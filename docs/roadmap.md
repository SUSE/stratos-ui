# Stratos Roadmap

Last Updated: 31 January 2018

The current high-level features are:

* Angular 2 - move to Angular 2 for the front-end UI
* Services - make Services a first-class citizen in the UI - See [here](planning/services.md)
* Metrics - add metrics to Stratos. See [here](planning/metrics.md) for some initial thoughts


## Agile

We work on a 2-week Sprint cycle. Sprints start on Wednesdays. For reference, Sprint 22 started 24 Jan 2018.

We are using GitHub issues to track all work items. We use ZenHub to manage these in an agile fashion - see:

## Angular 2

The focus for the first part of 2018 is to complete the move from AngularJS to Angular. This is a significant amount of work.

Note:
- Back-end stays the same (folder structure will most likely be moved around)
- Deployment and other scrpts, artefacts remaint the sames (tweaks as neccessary to build the V2 code)

Stack:

- Angular 5
- Typescript
- RxJS
- Angular Material
- Material Design => Adopt material design while keeping essence of the current Angular 1 app

We plan to accomplish this work in a number of milestones, so that we reach parity with the AngularJS version.
