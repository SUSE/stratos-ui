<h4 translate>Deploy Using CLI</h4>
<p translate>You are almost done!</p>
<p translate>To deploy your app, follow these steps:</p>
<p translate>1. Download the CLI.</p>
<p translate>2. Add a manifest.yml to your source code or update your existing one by <strong>copying & pasting</strong> the code below. Cloud Foundry uses the manifest file to set the application's name and route. Since the application and its route has been created for you, please ensure that the name, host and domain of your manifest file matches the example below. If the application name and route is not correct in the manifest file, two applications and routes will get created.</p>
